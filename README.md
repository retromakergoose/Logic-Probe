# Logic-Probe

Currently learning this Github with my first repository

This project is based on this 
https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/diy-tools-build-your-own-logic-probe/

This is a logic probe for testing circuits. I started this when i got a Commodore 64 and watched many Youtube videos on restoration in which logic probes were used for diagnoses.
